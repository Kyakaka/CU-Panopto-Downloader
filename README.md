# CU-Panopto-Downloader (Changed a bit)
Downloads Cardiff university lectures from panopto

**Forked from https://github.com/TThomasV/CU-Panopto-Downloader, go check the original version out, I just added some minor changes.**

*I ONLY added some ease-of-use improvements, one bug fix and an exe version for non CS students which only requires Firefox to be installed.*



- Need a Cardiff university account.
- Only works on windows right now (will probably remain that way).
- Works on Python 3.4 to 3.6, **WILL NOT WORK WITH HIGHER (from my testing)**
- Requires you have firefox installed, you can easily change this to chrome.


How to run the source code:
- Install requirements from requirements.txt -> pip install -r requirements.txt
- Run: python ./CU-Panopto-Downloader.py
- Videos can be found in the videos directory

I have also packed a exe version:
- Open the **panopto_downloader_packed** folder
- Double click **run_downloader.exe**
- What, are you expecting more steps?
